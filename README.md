# Market Content Optimizer

Market Content Optimizer is an open-source tool that leverages the **X (Twitter) API** and **Gemini API** to help brands like Microsoft generate and compare highly engaging, brand-authentic tweets—using real engagement data and state-of-the-art AI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Generate tweets** using few-shot learning, with your brand’s top-performing tweet examples.
- **Compare tweets** from different AI models, with predicted performance and detailed explanations.
- **Sentiment & engagement analysis** using Gemini API.
- **Modern, responsive UX** (Flask + JS/CSS).
- **Modular code** for easy extension.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Uses the **X API** to get real tweets and engagement data for your brand (Twitter handle).
2. Analyzes tweets using the **Gemini API** for sentiment, keywords, and engagement scores.
3. Collects top-performing tweets as few-shot examples for new generations.
4. When you submit a new prompt, Market Content Optimizer uses these examples to guide the Gemini model to generate and/or compare tweets, producing outputs and AI-driven explanations that are brand-authentic and optimized for engagement.

## 🛠️ Code Example: Gemini Prompt

```python
def execute_gemini(prompt: str):
    import google.ai.generativelanguage as genai
    client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"])
    response = client.generate_content(prompt=prompt)
    return response.text  # Or adapt to your Gemini setup
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

- Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (for Gemini API) and `X_BEARER_TOKEN` (for Twitter API v2) in `.env` or export them in your shell.
- Example `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
X_BEARER_TOKEN=your-twitter-bearer-token
```
